                                    The Golden Retriever is a large-sized breed of dog bred as gun dogs to retrieve shot waterfowl, such as ducks and upland game birds, during hunting and shooting parties,
                                    and were named 'retriever' because of their ability to retrieve shot game undamaged.Golden retrievers have an instinctive love of water, and are easy to train to basic or advanced obedience standards.
                                    They are a long-coated breed, with a dense inner coat that provides them with adequate warmth in the outdoors, and an outer coat that lies flat against their bodies and repels water.
                                    Golden retrievers are well suited to residency in suburban or country environments.
                             
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    The breed is a prominent participant in conformation shows for purebred dogs. The Golden Retriever is popular as a disability
                                    assistance dog, such as being a guide dog for the blind and a hearing dog for the deaf. In addition, they are trained to be a hunting dog, a detection dog, and a search and rescue participant.
                                    The breed's friendly, gentle temperament means it is unsuited to being a professional guard dog, but its temperament has also made it the third-most popular family dog breed (by registration) in the United States,
                                    the fifth-most popular in Brazil and Australia,and the eighth-most popular in the United Kingdom.

                                    The Golden Retriever is a large, strongly built breed with a dense, water-repellant wavy coat.
                                    As a dog with origins in pedigree breeding, and owing to its widespread historical popularity, some regional variations have emerged in the breed; therefore, the three subtypes of the Golden Retriever reflect the typical variations in dimensions and coat. 
                                    However, all Golden Retrievers are blonde, yellow, or gold in colour, and all subtypes are susceptible to the same health problems.

                                    British-type Golden Retrievers are prevalent throughout Europe and Australia.
                                    The skull is broader and the forequarters are more muscular than in other types. The muzzle is balanced and well chiseled.
                                    The coat is generally lighter in color than in the American types. 
                                    
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    The eyes are round and dark, which is in contrast to the triangular or slanted composition of their American counterparts.
                                    British Golden Retrievers can have a coat colour of any shade of gold or cream; red or mahogany are not permitted. 
                                    Originally, cream was an unacceptable colour in the UK standard, but the standard was revised in 1936 to include cream.

                        <p>
                                The temperament of the Golden Retriever is a hallmark of the breed, and is described in the standard as "kindly, friendly and confident".
                                Golden Retrievers make good family pets, particularly as they are patient with children.
                                


                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Golden Retrievers are also noted for their intelligence.
                                The breed ranks fourth in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs – following the Border Collie, Poodle, and German Shepherd – as one of the brightest dogs ranked by obedience-command trainability.
                                Typical Golden Retrievers are active and fun-loving animals with the exceptionally patient demeanour befitting a dog bred to sit quietly for hours in a hunting blind. 
                                
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Other characteristics related to their hunting heritage are a size suited for scrambling in and out of boats and an inordinate love for water.
                                Golden Retrievers are exceptionally trainable—due to their intelligence, athleticism and desire to please their handlers—and excel in obedience trials.
                                They are also very competitive in agility and other performance events.

                            <p>
                                    The average lifespan for a Golden Retriever is about 11 to 12 years.
                                    The breed is susceptible to specific ailments, so pets should be taken to a veterinarian for yearly checkups.
                                      
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    Golden Retrievers are known to have genetic disorders and other diseases.
                                    Hip dysplasia is common in the breed; when buying a puppy, the pedigree should be known and be examined by the OFA or by PennHIP for hip disease. 
                                    Obesity is also common in the breed because Golden Retrievers love to eat. 
                                    Puppies should eat about three cups of food a day and adults three to five cups, depending on the food and how active the dog is. 

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                    Cancer is the breed's biggest killer, causing 61.4% of American Golden deaths according to a 1998 health study conducted by the Golden Retriever Club of America
                                    The most common is hemangiosarcoma, followed by lymphosarcoma, mast cell tumour, and osteosarcoma.
                                    A 2004 survey by the UK Kennel Club puts this number at 38.8%.

                                The Golden Retriever's eagerness to please has made it a consistent, top performer in the obedience and agility rings. Its excellent swimming ability makes it proficient at dock jumping.
                                A natural retrieving ability means it is also competitive in flyball and field trials.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                The first three dogs ever to achieve the AKC Obedience Champion title were Golden Retrievers; the first of the three was a female named 'Ch. Moreland's Golden Tonka'.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Since Golden Retrievers are so trainable, they are used for many important jobs, such as guide dogs for blind people, drug or bomb sniffing at airports, or helping to rescuing people from earthquakes and other natural disasters.
                                This breed is also used in water rescue/lifesaving, along with the Leonberger, Newfoundland and Labrador Retriever dogs.
